\viewkind4\uc1\pard\fi144\li71\cf1\lang1033\f0\fs24 Times New Roman CE;Guin threw another log in the fire, blew softly in his small stove watching as the flame was slowly coming back to life. He sat on the little stool and crouched beside the metal heater, still shivering. His wrinkled palms engulfed now by the heat stopped their trembling and started to rub his shoulders setting the blood in motion. He has seen many winters and was now old, his body was starting to betray him, the cold, humid air of the West was not kind to him anymore. Yet that was no excuse leave the stormy wet lands of Galend and turn away from his duty for even though he was sixty, Guin was still a guardsman in the service of none other than Lord and high Pricnce Keelan Stout. A guardsman is a bit exaggerated to call him, for those days have been long gone and now he served only as a watchman in the small fort called Suil Nahel.\par
Suil Nahel, known in the old language as the eye of the cliff stands to this day on the tall western shores of Galend. It was built not so long ago on the highest rock guarding the north of Calmh bay\par
