He sat on the little stool and crouched beside the metal heater, still shivering. His wrinkled palms engulfed now by the heat stopped their trembling and started to rub his shoulders setting the blood in motion. He has seen many winters and was now old, his body was starting to betray him, the cold, humid air of the West was not kind to him anymore. Yet that was no excuse leave the stormy wet lands of Galend and turn away from his duty for even though he was sixty, \cf1 Guin\cf2  was still a guardsman in the service of none other than Lord and high Pric \cf1 Keelan\cf2  Stout, ruler of \cf1 Galend\cf2 .
